\begin{frame}{HTR: Baseline vs. BBoxes}
    Two HTR paradigms:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item HTR Engine based on baseline (through segmentation) that uncurves baselines and computes polygons around the line. That's what Kraken does. This allows for the handling of curved and round lines. Allows for more exotic situations.
        \item HTR Engine based on BBox or complex polygon: a rectangle is drawn around the text, leaving potential noise of the previous and next lines inside. Unable to deal with curved lines.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{The notion of Generic Models}
    \only<1-4>{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<1-> Generic Models are models thought to be compatible with a wide variety of documents, in a specified space: generic can be ultra-generic (any kind of script, any period) or generic within a smaller space (any Latin mss 10 to 12th cent)
            \item<2-> Generic Models aim at balancing overall accuracy on all documents rather than learning more about a single one.
            \item<3-> Specific Models are generally either created from scratch (trained from data of a specific manuscript or subset of), or derived from a generic model: we take the weight of a generic model and further teaches it to learn more about a new subset of documents.
            \item<4-> This Generic $\rightarrow$ Specific Models process is called fine-tuning, and it allows for faster training time (less energy, less money spent) but also in the case of small dataset better result: the model does not start from kindergarten again, and can keep some of its previous knowledge as well.

\section{So what if I go the editorial way ?}

\begin{frame}{A model is just as clever as its data}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A model is produced on data. \textbf{It learns what it sees}.
        \item A (Kraken) model \textbf{sees line by line}, it's the only context it has.
        \item A (Kraken) model does \textbf{learn some languages features by "accident"} when being trained. And the \textbf{more} a dataset is \textbf{multilingual} or include linguistic differences (lexical, spelling, syntax to a certain degree), the \textbf{more} it \textbf{resists} guessing based on linguistic features.
        \item As a consequence, a (Kraken) model \textbf{trained on one language} only will always \textbf{perform poorly on another language}, or to be precise, more poorly than if it had been trained on the second one: \textbf{models are lazy, they take the easy path.}
        \item You can teach a model to normalize text. But then, what am I teaching and asking from the model ? Am I giving the model as much knowledge as the editor has when they read (paratextual knowledge specifically) ?
        \item<2> \textbf{And if I do, because it's more convenient, what do I risk ?}

This is particularly crucial for addressing challenges such as complex layouts, ancient or noisy writing, or\textbf{out-of-domain issues, where a purely graphical interpretation may fall short} in providing an accurate transcription, as it lacks the linguistic nuances and contextual understanding that language models bring to the table. In contrast to classical CRNN models, which implicitly learn language features and focus on identifying patterns directly from the data [...], the integration of a language model involves a statistical analyze of how words interrelate in a language and the likelihood of certain sequences co-occurring.

Bustos”). Somehow, this was learned by the model but with mixed results. In cases where the enrollee has a second name and the model was able to understand which letter to use, Normalized DAN produced a correct output (i.e. correctly abbreviated the middle name). In other cases, it made a mistake when abbreviating the middle name. \textbf{In cases where no middle name was handwritten in the document, the model just invented one}, presumably to agree with the format of the data it was trained on.} \cite{normalizedvsdiplomatic}

\begin{frame}{And finally, what are the consequences}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There are very few combinations of fields (history, literature, philology, etc.), countries (France, Italy, Spain, Germany) or even subcategories (anglo-normand specialists vs. picard specialist) that would produce the same transcription depending on the tradition of their field.
        \item Any error is lost to the HTR: the decision to resolve is not visible in these models. The only reason these errors were caught is because papers' authors looked at the result.
        \item Punctuation, capitalization, normalization of abbreviation are domain-specific.
        \item<2> \textbf{This means that no datasets would be compatible !}
        \item<2> A solution is then to keep an approach that stay simple and leave some work for the researchers. And we can see how to address, domain per domain, what we can do to semi-automatize the translation.

        \item Ligatures between letters, such as \character{st} or \character{ct}, are treated as variations in form, leading to the independent transcription of their constituent characters.
        \item Any emphasis on the letter, regardless of its form, is transcribed as capital letters, including if the emphasis is only conveyed by the size of the letter (and does not result in a different shape).

    The various signs fall into two main categories:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A large number are additions to base letters with diacritical marks, such as macrons (\textit{e.g.} \character{ē} for \textit{est}, \textit{-em}, etc.), and superscript letters (\character{q\textsuperscript{i}} for \textit{qui}), and their meaning is often context-dependent. Diacritics are thus treated as separate characters using Unicode decomposed form (NFD).
        \item Few are separate semantically distinct signs, such as \character{\&} for \textit{et/e}), or letters with strike-through marks, such as \character{\juni{ꝑ}}. For these, we resorted to the  Medieval Unicode Font Initiative (MUFI) \cite{mufi2009}.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Guidelines: Ponctuation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Single full stops are transcribed as \character{.};
        \item Double signs are represented by \character{;};
        \item Commas are transcribed as \character{,},
        \item Question marks are transcribed as \character{?}, as soon as they appear in the Latin inventory in late middle ages.
